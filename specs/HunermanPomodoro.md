# App specifications
- Front-end only (can run on phone via GitHub Pages)
- Main page: 4 round buttons horizontally aligned
    - Pressing one of the buttons will start a 50-minute timer and turn the screen off (or fully black for energy saving) and prevents the phone to sleep.
    - At the end of the 50-minute timer, the screen will slowly turn on with a homogeneous purple color (the color of concentration)
    - If the user taps the screen, it will display the REST_TIMER (10 min, visible, sunset orange theme)
    - When the REST_TIMER is over, turn the theme to red. If user clicks, go back to the main page, and the button pressed by the user will be highlighted in green and show a checkmark. If pressing it again, reset it to default state.
